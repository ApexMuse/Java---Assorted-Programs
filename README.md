# Java---Assorted-Programs
Various Java programs

Problem 1 (Sort names without duplicates) Write a program that reads the names from all the ten text files provided, sorts all names (boy and girl names together, duplicates removed), and stores the sorted names in one file ten per line (only names, no ranks).

Problem 2 (Cumulative ranking) Write a program that obtains the cumulative ranking for the names in the ten years using the data from the ten files. You program should write to a file the cumulative ranking for boy’s names and to another file the cumulative ranking for girl’s names. For each name, display its ranking, name, and its cumulative count. 

Problem 3 (Remove ranking) Write a program that prompts the user to enter one of the file names described in Exercise 12.31, reads the data from the file, and stores the data in a new file without the rankings. The new file is the same as the original file except that it does not have the ranking for each row. The new file is named as the input file with the extension .new.

Problem 4  (SortArrayList) Write the following method that sorts an ArrayList of numbers:
public static void sort(ArrayList<Number> list)

Problem 5 (Geometry: two circles) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the center coordinates and radius of two circles. The program displays the circles and a text indicating whether the two are overlapping, whether one is contained in the other, or whether they don’t overlap.
